This will contain information regarding what I think the community pages should look like
(just wanna make sure we are all on the same page)

c_home.dart: 

--This will be the first page the user sees upon logging in 
--This should function like a "feed" page where the most recent posts are displayed first, user will 
  scroll to see older posts. This should mostly just be posts for the user's groups or people they follow.


c_groups.dart:

--Maybe a button at the top right? People icon
--This will be the page where users have the option to "Create a Group" or "Join / Explore Groups"
--Not sure yet where this should be accessed -- should there be a way to get to it from the users profile, or should
  there also be an option on the c_home.dart page to click on groups? 
--Maybe the explore portion is shown on the same page 


c_new_group.dart:

--This will be the page that a user is brought to once they click the "Create a Group" option 
--Should have typical questions (we can further discuss later)
